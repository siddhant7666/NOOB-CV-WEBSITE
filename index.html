        <p>I am currently a first-year undergrad at GGSIPU, Delhi, who hopes to learn new skills in computer software and coding. I have a lot of interest in quizzing and debating apart from computer science domain things, i also love to read
          history, particulary medieval history. Feel free to talk to me whenever you need someone to talk to while you are going through extreme phase of your life. Failed in anything or demotivated, leave me a mail or message i would love to talk
          to you and help you come out of the situation</p>
